As a result, we have to tell Git Bash to store the working directory, as it states <a href=\"http://conemu.github.io/en/ShellWorkDir.html#bash_and_other_cygwin_shells\">here in the docs</a>.</p>\n<p>Open your text editor, or the terminal, and create a file in <code>~/</code> called <code>.bash_profile</code> and enter the contents which the Con Emu documentation states, which is shown below. After creating this file and entering the contents below, it should start remembering the directories.</p>\n<pre><code>PROMPT_COMMAND='ConEmuC -StoreCWD'\n</code></pre>\n<p>The file is <code>.bash_profile</code>, and not <code>.bashrc</code> because apparently when Git Bash is run with the <code>--login</code> flag, it reads the settings from <code>.bash_profile</code> and not <code>.bashrc</code>. The place I found this was a reply to a <a href=\"http://superuser.com/questions/602872/how-do-i-modify-my-git-bash-profile-in-windows\">Stackoverflow question</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>~/</code> is an alias for the home directory of your user, e.g. <code>C:\\Users\\{yourusername}</code>, so the file's location would be <code>C:\\Users\\{yourusername}\\.bash_profile</code> .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Further Resources</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6883760/git-for-windows-bashrc-or-equivalent-config-files-for-git-bash-shell\">bashrc or equivalent config for Windows</a></p>\n"
