You'd think it would'd be correct to say, but it's not. There are <a href=\"https://perishablepress.com/a-killer-collection-of-global-css-reset-styles\">actually several different resets</a> that have been created over time. While some wipe out all styles, some give default styling. There are also some that include a few fixes for browser inconsistencies.</p>\n<p>What connects all of them together, though, is that their main purpose is to set a baseline for element styles. Even if they do include  some fixes for browser inconsistencies, that's not their main purpose. This is where <code>normalize.css</code> differs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-normalize-css\">What is normalize.css?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css\">Normalize.css</a> is a stylesheet created by <a href=\"http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/\">Necolas Gallagher and Jon Neal</a> (and I'm sure contributed to by many others). It's not really a reset since it doesn't strip away a lot of styles. If you look <a href=\"https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/blob/master/normalize.css\">at the source</a>, you'll see it actually doesn't affect many elements. What <code>normalize</code> does include is a wide set of fixes for various default styling bugs and inconsistencies between browsers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"does-it-really-work-though\">Does it really work though?</h3>\n<p>We'll use a real life example that I came across while working at Plaid.</p>\n<figure>\n  <figcaption>\n    <a href=\"https://plaid.com/how-it-works\">plaid.com/how-it-works</a> in IE11\n  </figcaption>\n  <img src=\"/images/posts/use-normalize-css/normalize-before+c.png\" alt=\"page without normalize\" width=\"500px\">\n</figure>\n<p>The page above is a screenshot the <code>/how-it-works</code> page of <a href=\"https://plaid.com/how-it-works\">plaid.com</a> using IE11. The page is clearly broken, but looks fine on any browser that isn't IE. So what gives?</p>\n<h4 id=\"a-broken-main\">A broken main</h4>\n<p>One of <em>many</em> problems with IE browsers is that they don't properly default the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag to be a block element but are instead to be inline. What happens to the page if we set the main tag to display block? Well, let's see!</p>\n<figure>\n  <figcaption>The page with &lt;main&gt; set to <code>display: block</code></figcaption>\n  <img src=\"/images/posts/use-normalize-css/normalize-after+c.png\" alt=\"page with \" width=\"500px\">\n</figure>\n<p>Hey, what do you know? Everything looks mostly as it should (although that heading and text is looking a little squished, which is actually another IE bug with <code>ch</code> units).</p>\n<h4 id=\"what-does-this-have-to-do-with-normalize\">What does this have to do with normalize?</h4>\n<p>When I was working at Plaid, we only used a CSS reset (I'm unsure of which one). If <code>normalize</code> was brought in from the beginning, this wouldn't have been an issue because it's a case that normalize covers. Again, <code>normalize</code> is filled with fixes like this and is much more thorough than any of the fixes in other resets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-small-too\">It's small too</h3>\n<p>If you're worried about performance, then think about this. Normalize is <code>6KB</code> with majority of it being mostly comments. Running it through a minifer will cut the size down to <code>1.8KB</code> (with the license intact) and our good old friend gzip will cut that size to less than half. <code>780 bytes</code> is nothing in the grand scheme of things, especially for something that can have a positive effect on a project. I think it's definitely worth adding.</p>\n<pre><code>Bytes   File\n 6052   normalize.css\n 1783   normalize.min.css\n  782   normalize.min.css.gz\n</code></pre>\n<p>tl;dr Use normalize. It's not just a browser reset, it actually fixes shit.</p>\n<div class=\"Aside\">\n  <div class=\"Aside-content\">\n    <div class=\"Aside-tag  [ Tag is-absolute ]\">Funny enough</div>\n    The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> fix was <a href=\"https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/issues/727\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">inadvertently removed from</a> the project somewhere around <code>v8.0.0</code>. I can assure you that the IE <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag is still an issue and the fix needs to be added back into normalize.\n  </div>\n</div>\n"
