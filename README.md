# My website

This is my site. Cool, init? 


## Notes

The Sass will be compiled with Jekyll when it's hosted on Github Pages. For development, the Sass is compiled by gulp-sass and dested straight to _site/css, which will mean faster reload times for browser-sync. The stylesheets that are dested to `assets/stylesheets/` are there only to be able to view the size of the compressed and uncompressed files their file sizes (which I can do with a plugin I wrote for Sublime Text).


## Todo

- Change the look of the form
- Clean up the color situation
- Fix form responsiveness
- Rename CodepenPreviewList to gallery or something
- Change post title and post preview title size
- Fix 404 page
- Change page header at mobile width
