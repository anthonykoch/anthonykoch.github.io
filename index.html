			<p>
				Well, as I said before, I'm a front-end developer, which if you simplify it down, it basically means I build websites. I have a wealth of knowledge in HTML, CSS, responsive design, as well as some knowledge in server side scripting languages such as PHP and NodeJS.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm a big fan of JavaScript, Node, and Python, and have built some open source projects using them. If you'd like to see some of my code, I have some cool stuff on my <a href="{{ site.data.social.github.link }}">Github</a> and <a href="{{ site.data.social.codepen.link }}">Codepen</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				P.S. I also do a bit of blogging, where I write mostly on topics surrounding front-end development. Be sure to check it <a href="/blog">out</a>.
